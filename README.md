# KristinMcCollum-portfolio

Hi! Welcome to my portfolio site. It will grow and change as my skills do.

I built this as the culmination of my experience in Juno College of Technology's Immersive Web Development Bootcamp. 
I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Juno. They have excellent instructors and foster a community of inclusivity so that students feel empowered and supported.

Built with HTML5, CSS3 and Sass, along with some JavaScript functionality. I really enjoy using Sass. I like the organization and structure it provides.
I also enjoy JavaScript as it appeals to my logic and puzzle-solving brain.

The design was inspired by a site by Sharuk Rahman Shawon that I found on Behance. https://www.behance.net/shawonrahman3

The typing effect is from typed.js http://www.mattboldt.com/

Please let me know if you have any questions about anything you see here.
